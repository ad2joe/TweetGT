TweetGT - Tweets: Geotagged 

This is a simple Zend Framework project that allows you to post a geotagged tweet. A working
implementation is available at http://tweetgt.funkymongoose.com.

It uses Twitter's OAuth authentication system (via Zend_Oauth_Consumer) so that you
don't need to give the application your login details.
